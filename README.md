# Drywall_Two
The sequeal to my original Drywall application! This is a unique and powerfull wallpaper dashboard application for android that is powered by RSS instead of JSON and comes with some wallpaper management tools! Minimalism in mind and fluent transitioning.

To Do 
-Add item transition animations from list item to preview activity
-Make sure wallpaper titles fit title bar
-More wallpaper management tools
-Make Shared Preferences not require an app restart to apply values
-Possible to add FX affects to current wallpaper?
-Add CropActivity to pick photo from gallery
